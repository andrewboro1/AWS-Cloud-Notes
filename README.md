# AWS-Cloud-Notes

This repo will contain a series of folders documenting the learing tools that assisted me in my AWS Cloud journey.

My aim is to provide a foundation of materials that can be built upon by self exploration and is in no means meant to serve as a be all end all resource list.

I will continue to update this repo with relevant links, documents, personal notes and resources that I find help me understand the core topics in preparation for the certification exams. 

At this time I am currently studying for the Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect Associate & SysOps Associate certifications so the material I share will be in aid for these exams only. 

Leave a star if any of the resources help you and point others in the right direction. 

At the time of writing this i'm still working my way around understanding Github however links from anyone who has studied for these certifications or currently studying for them are welcomed so please contribute in any way that you can and help others get their leg on the ladder!
